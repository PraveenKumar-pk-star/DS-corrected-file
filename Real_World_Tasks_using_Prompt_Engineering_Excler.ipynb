              "    *   **Oven Method:** Preheat the oven to 300°F (150°C). Place the covered pot in the oven and bake for 25-30 minutes.\n",

              "*   **Mint and Coriander:** Don't skimp on the fresh herbs. They add a refreshing flavor to the biryani.\n",

              "\n",
              "* **Error Handling:** Includes a `try-except` block to gracefully handle the `FileNotFoundError` if the data files are missing.  This prevents the script from crashing.\n",
              "* **Clearer Data Loading:**  Loads both `train.csv` and `test.csv` at the beginning.\n",
              "* **Combined Data Preprocessing:**  Crucially, *combines* the training and testing data *before* preprocessing (using `pd.concat`).  This ensures that the same transformations are applied consistently to both datasets, preventing data leakage and ensuring that the test data is transformed in the same way as the training data.  This is essential for accurate predictions on the test set.  Then, the combined data is split back into training and test sets *after* preprocessing.\n",
              "* **`handle_unknown='ignore'` in OneHotEncoder:**  This is *extremely* important.  If the test data contains categories that were not present in the training data, the `OneHotEncoder` will throw an error unless you set `handle_unknown='ignore'`. This ensures that the test data can be processed even if it contains new categories.\n",
              "* **`remainder='passthrough'` in ColumnTransformer:**  This ensures that any columns not explicitly transformed are passed through without modification.  While not strictly necessary in this example *now*, it's good practice to include it in case you add or remove features later.\n",
              "* **`SimpleImputer` with 'most_frequent':** Uses `SimpleImputer` with `strategy='most_frequent'` for categorical features like 'Embarked'. This is generally better than filling with a specific value like 'S', as it uses the most common value in the dataset.  Also uses 'median' for numerical features.\n",
              "* **Feature Engineering:** Includes examples of feature engineering: `FamilySize`, `IsAlone`, and extracting `Title` from `Name`. Feature engineering can significantly improve model performance. The `Title` feature is handled more robustly by grouping less common titles.\n",
              "* **Feature Selection:** Includes an example of dropping less informative features.\n",
              "* **Data Scaling:** Uses `StandardScaler` to scale numerical features. This is important for algorithms that are sensitive to feature scaling, such as Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting. Scales binary features as well, which, although not always necessary, can sometimes improve performance.\n",
              "* **Pipelines:** Uses `Pipeline` to chain together the preprocessing steps and the model. This makes the code cleaner and easier to maintain, and it prevents data leakage.\n",
              "* **Grid Search:** Uses `GridSearchCV` to find the best hyperparameters for each model. This ensures that the models are well-tuned for the data.  Hyperparameter grids are defined for each model.\n",
              "* **Validation Set:** Splits the training data into training and validation sets. This allows you to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data during training and tune hyperparameters accordingly.\n",
              "* **Clearer Model Training and Evaluation:**  Each model (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) is trained and evaluated separately, with its own hyperparameter tuning.\n",
              "* **Model Selection:**  Explicitly selects the best model based on validation accuracy.\n",
              "* **Prediction on Test Data:**  Uses the *best* model to make predictions on the final test data.\n",
              "* **Submission File Creation:** Creates a submission file in the correct format for Kaggle.\n",
              "* **Visualization:**  Includes examples of visualization: confusion matrix and feature importance.\n",
              "* **Comments and Explanation:** Includes detailed comments explaining each step of the code.\n",
              "* **Suppressed Warnings:**  Includes `warnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")` to suppress warnings and keep the output cleaner.\n",
              "* **`random_state`:**  Sets `random_state` in the models and train_test_split for reproducibility.\n",
              "* **NumPy Import:**  Explicitly imports NumPy for numerical operations.\n",
              "* **Clearer Variable Names:** Uses more descriptive variable names.\n",
              "* **Concise Output:** Prints only missing values, best parameters, best scores, and validation accuracy.\n",
              "* **Code Organization:** The code is well-organized into sections with clear headings.\n",
              "* **`fit_transform` vs. `transform`:** Correctly uses `fit_transform` on the training data and `transform` on the validation and test data to prevent data leakage.\n",
              "* **`get_feature_names_out`:** Uses `preprocessor.get_feature_names_out()` to get the feature names after one-hot encoding for visualization of feature importances. This is crucial for correctly interpreting the feature importances.\n",

              "* **Error Handling:**  Crucially includes `try...except FileNotFoundError` to handle the case where the 'housing.csv' file is not found.  Also checks for the presence of the 'MEDV' target variable and specified features.  This is *essential* for robustness.  Exits the script gracefully if the data is missing.  This prevents the script from crashing.\n",
              "* **Clearer Data Loading:** Assumes 'housing.csv' is in the same directory.  The comment explicitly tells the user to change the filename/path if needed.\n",
              "* **Explicit Feature Selection:**  Instead of `data.drop`, the code now *explicitly* selects the features using `data[features]`.  This is much more robust and avoids potential issues if the column order or presence of extra columns changes in the dataset. Includes a check to make sure the selected features exist in the DataFrame before proceeding.\n",
              "* **`random_state` for Reproducibility:**  Adds `random_state=42` to `train_test_split` and `XGBRegressor` to ensure consistent results across multiple runs.  This is good practice for machine learning.\n",
              "* **Scaling:** Uses `StandardScaler` to scale the features.  This is important for linear models and often improves the performance of XGBoost as well.  The scaler is *fitted* on the *training* data and then *transformed* on both training and testing data to prevent data leakage.\n",
              "* **Model Saving/Loading (Persistence):** Uses `joblib` to save the trained XGBoost model to a file ('boston_housing_xgboost.pkl') and the scaler to 'boston_housing_scaler.pkl'. This allows you to reuse the trained model later without retraining.  Includes code to load the saved model and make a prediction on a new input.  *Critically, it saves and loads the scaler as well.*  This is often missed but is absolutely necessary to scale new data correctly when making predictions.\n",
              "* **Clearer Output:**  Prints more informative messages during each stage of the process.\n",
              "* **Visualization:** Adds optional visualization of predicted vs. actual values and the distribution of residuals.  This helps in understanding the model's performance.  A diagonal line is added to the scatter plot to visually assess the prediction accuracy.\n",
              "* **Comprehensive Comments:**  Includes detailed comments explaining each step of the code.\n",
              "* **Handles Missing Data (Checks for it):** Includes code to check for missing values (`data.isnull().sum()`) and prints the result.  While this dataset is typically clean, it's good practice to check.  If there were missing values, you would need to impute them (e.g., using `SimpleImputer` from `sklearn.impute`) before training the model.\n",
              "* **Prediction Example:** Shows how to load the saved model and scaler and make a prediction on new data.  This is a complete, runnable example.\n",
              "* **Pandas DataFrame Input for Prediction:** The prediction example uses a Pandas DataFrame for input, which is more realistic and handles column names correctly.\n",
              "* **Addresses Potential Column Name Issues:** By explicitly specifying the features, the code avoids potential issues if the column names in the dataset are different from what the code expects.\n",
              "* **Conciseness and Readability:** The code is formatted for readability and avoids unnecessary complexity.\n",
              "* **Correct Evaluation:** Calculates and prints both Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared for both models.\n",
              "* **Exit on Error:** Uses `exit()` to stop the script if a critical error (like the file not being found) occurs.  This prevents the script from continuing with invalid data.\n",

Ensure the model you choose is available in your Google AI Studio account.\n",

        "After more than two months of caustic words for Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and approbation for Russian President Vladimir Putin, U.S. President Donald Trump appeared to strike a different note in his approach towards bringing the two leaders to the negotiating table. Following a call with Mr. Putin, Mr. Trump said that he was “very angry” with the former when, following weeks of attempted negotiations, Mr. Putin reportedly attacked Mr. Zelenskyy’s credibility instead of discussing steps towards finding peace. Further, Mr. Trump, apparently irate that his campaign promise to end the conflict was losing steam and in danger of remaining unfulfilled, threatened to slap nations purchasing Russian oil with a 50% tariff, unless Mr. Putin agreed to a ceasefire in the near term. The choke point was Mr. Putin’s insistence that Mr. Zelenskyy lacks the legitimate authority to sign a robust peace deal that would not be challenged by any nation; and that in this context the introduction of “temporary governance in Ukraine,” was required, perhaps achieved through “democratic elections, to bring to power a viable government that enjoys the trust of the people…\n",
        "In terms of his popularity back home, Mr. Zelenskyy had earlier corrected a broadside from Mr. Trump, a false claim that he only had an approval rating of 4%, when in fact Kiev had noted that 65% of Ukrainians trusted their President and his approval rating hovered around 57% in early 2025. Mr. Putin’s claims in this regard, which range from the unfounded statements about Mr. Zelenskyy lacking popular legitimacy to accusing him, a leader of Jewish descent, of enabling Nazi forces in Ukraine, can be understood in the backdrop of Moscow’s reluctance to enter into a peace treaty at a time when its troops have continued to keep up the military pressure on Ukrainian forces and have made substantial territorial gains there. The greater concern for Europe, and perhaps the U.S., might be that Mr. Putin could seek to undermine via influence operations any plan for free and fair elections in Ukraine and thus succeed in getting a pro-Russian candidate installed in Kiev. In turn, Mr. Trump, even if he is not particularly concerned with European security in a post-conflict scenario in Ukraine that might favour Russian interests, may worry that a lucrative U.S.-Ukraine mineral extraction deal might be in jeopardy if Mr. Putin is de facto calling the shots across the region. Regardless of the bluster on all sides, an early ceasefire would have the greatest impact on prospects for lasting peace after more than three years of bloodshed and dislocation.\n",

Putin questioned Zelenskyy's legitimacy and called for \"temporary governance\" in Ukraine through elections. Zelenskyy refuted Trump's claim of low approval ratings, citing higher figures.
